## Less Mess

### Summary:
* Less Mess was created by a team of five developers to reduce and bring awareness to littered areas in the community. 

### Key Features:
* Users are able to register/login and report messes that they find. When reporting a mess, users are able to name the mess, input the location, indicate the level of concern, and lastly take a photo of the actual mess.
* Users in the community will be able to view all messes with it's respective details in a global view.
* Users can then decide to clean messes in their community. By snapping a a photo of the newly cleaned area, the mess will be removed from view, and the user will be awarded merritt points for their efforts!
* Less Mess also provides a niche feature unique to a current epidemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, the use of syringes. If users stumble upon a syringe, they are able to select the medical waste button, which will prompt them to provide the location of the syringe. Once that is completed, the application will automatically report the syringe to the proper authorities, San Francisco 311, which will then have trained professionals dispose of the waste.
